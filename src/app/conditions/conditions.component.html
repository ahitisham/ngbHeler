			<p><strong>VAGINAL HYPERTROPHY</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#AA002D"><strong>Vaginal Health&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p>Vaginal lasers are a new gynecology solution for treatment of vaginal health related conditions. Vaginal health related conditions such as vaginal atrophy and urinary incontinence are concerning a large population of post-menopausal women and women after child birth. Laser based technologies and specifically fractional CO2 lasers, have been proven to significantly improve symptoms of vaginal health related conditions. The CO2 wavelength of 10.6µm has a very high affinity with the water of the vaginal mucosa and histological data shows that CO2 vaginal rejuvenation lasers caused a thickening and regeneration of the vaginal mucosa.<br>
The Lumenis solution&nbsp;<br>
FemTouch™ is a gynecology laser solution developed by Lumenis in collaboration with leading gynecologists. FemTouch is based on a CO2technology that has been used for over two decades to perform various vaginal, robotic and laparoscopic procedures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
FemTouch addresses vaginal health related conditions by delivering low levels of CO2 energy in a fractional pattern uniformly along the vaginal wall. The laser energy gently ablates and coagulates the vaginal tissue and in turn promotes the remodeling of the vaginal mucous epithelium layer.<br>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#AA002D"><strong>What is Vaginal Atrophy?</strong></span><br>
Vaginal ageing or Vaginal Atrophy occurs in approximately 40% of women&nbsp;going through menopause. Vaginal Atrophy, also called atrophic vaginitis, is caused by the natural aging process through a drop in estrogen due to menopause, after childbirth, or as a result of the treatment of some gynaecologic cancers. &nbsp;Prior to menopause, the vaginal lining appears thick, bright red, and moist. However, as estrogen levels decline, the lining of the vagina becomes thinner, drier and less elastic as a result of lost collagen in the vaginal wall.<br>
<em>Physiological signs and associated symptoms</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><br>
<span style="color:#AA002D"><strong>While it’s obvious that Vaginal Atrophy can cause emotional distress, the most common physiological signs involve:</strong></span></p>

	<li style="text-align:justify">Dehydration (lack of lubrication)</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Natural elasticity is reduced</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Reduced blood supply</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Patients suffering from Vaginal Atrophy usually experience the following symptoms:</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Itchiness</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Pain during intercourse</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Poor vaginal lubrication</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Loosening of the vagina</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Incontinence and the need to urgently urinate</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">A burning feeling or irritation</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Pain during intercourse</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#AA002D"><strong>What causes Vaginal Atrophy?</strong></span><br>
Vaginal Atrophy can be caused or induced by menopause, and as such is usually experienced by women at around the age of 45 and 55. However, it can also be caused by the prolonged use of the pill, traumatic birth resulting in scarring and severe damage or trauma. It can also develop during breast-feeding or at any other time your body’s estrogen production declines.<br>
In addition, other factors that can cause decrease a woman’s estrogen levels that can lead to Vaginal Atrophy include:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Stress</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Depression</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Strenuous exercise</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Removal of the ovaries</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Radiation and chemotherapy treatments to the pelvic area can also result in lower estrogen levels.</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Stress urinary incontinence results from weakening of the uterus fundus muscles and stretching of the vagina, which changes the angle of the female urethra.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#AA002D"><strong>The impact on your quality of life, health and sexuality</strong></span><br>
Vaginal Atrophy can also have devastating effects on your sexual health—women with this condition are nearly four times more likely to experience sexual function disorders compared with those women with healthy vaginal tissue. As a result of the pain and discomfort during intercourse, many women avoid intimacy with their partner, causing further emotional distress for both partners.<br>
In addition to the impact on sexuality and intercourse, this condition can also affect urinary function, where women experience incontinence and the need to urgently urinate, or have difficulty performing simple daily activities such as sitting and exercising.<br>
If left untreated, patients may experience more serious health complications. Since Vaginal Atrophy has a direct effect on the acidic environment of the vagina, patients are at higher risk of infection, or vaginitis, as a result of a build-up of bacteria, also known as candida. FemTouch™ works to counteract the effects of Vaginal Atrophy with a simple 10&nbsp;minute treatment, utilizing highly sophisticated technology that prevents infections from developing whilst restoring the vaginal wall strength and blood supply.</p>
